## 🌟 Key Modules & Capabilities

### 1. 📊 Financial Overview Dashboard
- **KPI Metrics**: Real-time tracking of Total Employees, Total Monthly Payroll, Disbursed Salary, and Pending Payouts.
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive salary expenditure trends (monthly bar/line charts) and department-wise cost distribution.
- **Paid vs. Pending Visualization**: Quick glance at payout completion rates.
- **Audit Activity Feed**: Timestamped stream of recent approvals, drafts, and disbursements.

### 3. 💳 Payroll Management & Processing
- **Automated Calculation Engine**:
  $$\text{Gross Salary} = \text{Basic} + \text{Allowances} + \text{Bonus} + \text{Overtime}$$
  $$\text{Total Deductions} = \text{Deductions} + \text{Tax}$$
  $$\text{Net Salary} = \text{Gross Salary} - \text{Total Deductions}$$
- **Negative Salary Safeguard**: Strict calculation validation preventing negative net salaries.
- **Batch Processing**: One-click batch approval and disbursement for selected departments or employees.
- **Status Workflow**: Clear transitions from `Draft` $\rightarrow$ `Approved` $\rightarrow$ `Paid`.
- **Payroll History**: Searchable archive of all historical payroll runs with granular detail views.

### 4. 📄 Interactive Payslips & PDF Generation
- **Branded Templates**: Clean, professional printable payslips with company header, employee details, earnings, and deductions.
- **Client-Side PDF Export**: High-fidelity PDF generation via `jsPDF` and `html2canvas` for download or print.
- **Employee Self-Service**: Employees can securely access and download their historical payslips.

### 5. 📈 Financial & Tax Reports
- **Salary Report**: Detailed breakdowns of gross, net, deductions, and tax withholdings.
- **Department Cost Center**: Expense distribution and headcount analysis by organizational unit.
- **Payment Reconciliation**: Breakdown across Bank Transfer, Mobile Banking, Cash, and Checks.
- **Yearly Summary**: Quarterly aggregations and year-over-year expenditure patterns.
- **Export Formats**: One-click exports to **Excel (`.xlsx`)** and **CSV**.

### 6. 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Security
- **Multi-Role Support**: Tailored interfaces and permissions for `Owner`, `Admin`, `Accountant`, `HR`, and `Employee`.
- **1-Click Demo Login**: Switch roles instantly from the login screen for testing and evaluation.
- **Data Persistence**: Robust client-side state persistence via `localStorage` with seed data pre-loaded (~25 employees, 6 months historical payroll).
